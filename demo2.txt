It was a rainy evening when Arjun took shelter inside an old building near the market.
He had been walking home from school when the heavy rain started suddenly.
The place looked dark and quiet, with dust on every corner.
A small wooden board near the door said, "Town Public Library."
Arjun was surprised because he had never seen this library open before.
He stepped inside and saw hundreds of books arranged on tall shelves.
The smell of old paper filled the air.
The light was dim, and he could hear the sound of rain hitting the roof.
As he walked between the shelves, he noticed that each book had strange golden letters on its cover.
Some books even looked older than his grandparents.
Suddenly, he heard a soft voice behind him. "Do you like stories?"
Arjun turned around quickly.
An old man was standing there with a kind smile on his face.
He had round glasses and a small lantern in his hand.
Arjun nodded shyly.
The man handed him a dusty red book and said, "This one chooses its reader."
Arjun opened the book and felt a strange breeze pass by.
The words on the page began to glow faintly.
He saw pictures moving like small films on the paper.
The story inside was about a brave boy who explored magical lands.
As Arjun kept reading, he realized the boy in the story looked just like him.
Before he could ask the old man anything, lightning flashed outside, and the man disappeared.
The library doors creaked open by themselves.
Arjun quickly ran home, holding the red book close to his chest.
When he reached home, he opened it again - but the pages were blank.
From that day, he always wondered if the library was real or just a dream.
