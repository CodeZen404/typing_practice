It was a bright and sunny day.
The sky was blue and the air was cool.
Riya woke up early and felt happy.
She wanted to go to the park with her little brother, Arjun.
After breakfast, they packed a ball, some water, and a few snacks.
Their mother smiled and said, "Have fun, but come home before lunch."
The park was full of green trees and colorful flowers.
Birds were singing in the branches.
Some kids were playing on the swings and slides.
Riya and Arjun ran to the open field and started playing catch with the ball.
They laughed when the ball went far away.
A small puppy came running to them.
It wagged its tail and barked softly.
Arjun threw the ball, and the puppy brought it back.
They played together for a long time.
After some time, they sat under a big tree to rest.
They drank water and ate cookies.
The wind was gentle and the leaves made a soft sound.
Riya looked at the sky and saw white clouds moving slowly.
She felt calm and peaceful.
When it was time to go home, they said goodbye to the puppy and walked back.
It was a simple day, but a very happy one.
